                    Computer science is a booming industry over the past decades and it continues to grow in importance and relevance in this Information Age. 
                    One of the growing pains I have seen as a newcomer to this industry is hastily put together foundation to build up the youth for this field.
                    My high school courses as well as the courses at schools I student taught at all had mediocre computer science departments where the teacher was often forced into that role.
                    Quality teaching is fundamental to the development of the next generation, and I hope to be part of your joint effort to make sure this subject continues to flourish.

                    <strong>Programming is difficult.</strong> Let me revise that. Programming well is difficult, while programming in general is quite simple. 
                    There are two main hurdles I have seen all computer science students face. The first is learning <strong>how to break down the problem into logical steps.</strong>
                    Thinking in logical steps that break down a problem into inputs and outputs is a process that is foreign to many. Similar to how people say they do not have a brain for math, this is the same type of hurdle.
                    We have to build up and practice looking at problems from a different viewpoint to solve these problems.
                    Once this is built up, programming is deeply intuitive and becomes a natural process in how we observe the natural world. 
                    Passing this hurdle is what makes a programmer who can solve problems and write code for a job. 
                    Programming well is the next hurdle where we learn <strong>how to optimize problems</strong> in an unconventional way to get the best solution. 
                    We have to dive deeper and deeper to find more elegant solutions and discover how vast this field truly is. 
                    I hope to guide students to find joy in discovery that fuels them to continue beyond my guidance. This drive to be better is what makes a good programmer.

                                Programming often involves a repetition of small tasks. For example, adding two values takes a lot of work on the computer's end, but we can simply use the addition symbol to tell the computer what to do. This unit dives into learning how to make instruction sets that can be generalized to solve a common problem. It expands the problem solving mindset to include thinking for other scenarios.

                                Strings are what programmers call a sequence of characters. It is an unusual data type with how it is stored and how it can be used. In the beginning context, it is a familiar format that allows students to understand objects and the personal functions that an object can have. Projects will be centered around manipulating different strings and prepare students for the concept of arrays.

                                Not all inputs are the same. Conditional statements allow us to now create a branching flow-chart to solve a problem. Variables of the problem are determined and comparisons are made to create a solution to a problem that produces the correct outputs. This is the last step that is fully procedural programming for the students.

                                To optimize a program and to allow it to go beyond human capabilities, there is the tool of iterations. Snippets of code are repeated over an over to manipulate data thousands of times to return a desired result. Problems can not be solved one step at a time now, but the problem has to be generalized to allow a pattern to be seen.

                                This final unit serves as an introduction to the wide array of data types that are used in higher levels of programming. Arrays are a collection of a singular data type which allows for larger programs. Projects can now include large amounts of data and the need for efficient programming can now be felt by the programmers.
