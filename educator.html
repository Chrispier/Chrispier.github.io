                        <li><strong>Guidance</strong> provided as I have to acknowledge the influence I will have on some students. Beyond being a teacher, I am a person who they look up to, so I should act appropriately to best guide them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Everyone can Learn High School Math</strong> given adequate resources. As a result, effort should be put in for every student to assist them and not give up on them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Love for the Subject</strong> is visibly portrayed in my understanding and continued study of both subject matters.

                        <li><strong>Exploration</strong> by using personal experiences allows scaffolding with a sound foundation or support. Concepts can be introduced with a personal experience that relates to students or build up to a connection. These connections deepen student understanding and build up flexibility in their application of the knowledge</li>
                        <li><strong>Explanation</strong> of the deeper reasoning is one way of acknowledging the students as mathematicians and programmers. Since these subjects are structured to build upon prior knowledge, fully understanding where these concepts derive from builds connections within the content.</li>
                        <li><strong>Practice</strong> is how I found myself learning content. Knowing the concepts is one part and being able to decipher problems into smaller steps and apply the knowledge to solve each step is the other.</li>
                        <li><strong>Individual Support</strong> through office hours and building a culture that promotes asking for assistance. It is inevitable that students will need additional support and I want to cultivate a culture that normalizes seeking support by providing an open door to students who desire assistance. I make sure to take the time to aid students in understanding and answering every question they may have.</li>

                    <p><i>When directing a message, knowing the audience is a key factor to ensuring 
                        the purpose is fulfilled. In my case as an educator, I have to take into consideration 
                        all variables related to each student's learning experience. Three key factors to focus on 
                        are their development, their differences, and the environment. 
                    </i></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>My approach is a student-centered approach with the main goal of each lesson being "how can each student take away the main goal of this lesson?" In my experience in the classroom and use of texts, I have found modeling problems and practice to be necessary when explaining the theory behind new concepts. Logical thinking for STEM subjects is a skill that can be developed that often dissuades students in these subjects. By interweaving sections of modeled examples and time to practice with the theory, this provides students with differentiated access to the material, students to individually assess their understanding, and build up a classroom with active engagement.</li>
                        <li>I am constantly looking to improve and test out different ways to reach every learner. I know that this is impossible, so I also make an emphasis on exposing students to a wide variety of learning opportunities to let them personally determine which method is best for them. Groupwork is mixed with individual time. The information is provided with lecture slides, presented verbally, modeled, and the theory is explained to them. Homework is provided, but it is also mentioned that the questions are mostly from the textbook which has dozens of more questions on each topic that they can try out. This transparency is a lot of additional work, but it has worked wonders in building a classroom of students who are responsive in activities and engaged because they engage with the part of the lesson that works for them. Verbally communicating the topics in a clear and concise manner is an area that I have focused my growth in. By focusing on development, I have been able to make my questions more direct and better guide students along their thought process to solve problems.</li>
                        <li>Sample Lesson
                            <iframe src="3_28_23 Trig identities 1_2 Lesson Plan.pdf" width="100%" height="800px"></iframe> 
                            </li>
                        <li>This lesson plan utilizes a wide variety of how the information is presented with the use of modeling (and practicing) examples, formulas to memorize, and deriving the formulas. These different methods provides students different ways to access the material as some require practice to understand the concepts, some want steps to memorize, and others want to understand the full picture and how these formulas are derived. These different ways of interacting with the material address the different ways the learners develop their knowledge. Differentiation is further implemented with challenge problems near the end that allow those who are more comfortable with the content to apply it in multi-step problems. While they work on the challenge problems, and others work on the given problems, I can spend my time circulating the classroom and individually assisting students to ensure each learner meets their goals. This is also possible through the consistent practice that is respected by the learners. The routine of practice was made normal over the weeks and now the classroom environment is a productive space. I also worked in building up the classroom environment by being prepared to answer any question and ask relevant questions that meet any immediate needs. This helped build up relationships with the students and overall classroom culture. </li>

                </div>
                <div class="subheader blocked">_Content Knowledge</div>
                <div class="list" id="Values">
                    <p><i>As an educator, I am ultimately there to provide the students with the knowledge that I have been tasked to provide. In my case, it is mathematics and computer science and I have to personally be comfortable with the content as well as be able to present the content for the students to interact with.</i></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I believe that content knowledge is one of my strengths as an educator. An objective metric used to measure the effectiveness of my teaching is how well my students have been able to understand the content knowledge. Especially as a math teacher since math ability is a metric used in grading schools. I also am very aware of what the standards required by the NYS Regents or College Board's AP's are. As a result, I focus my lessons on the key concepts required to build a strong foundation and the levels of details needed to build up mastery of the content for each student. Knowing the foundation also is important as I can focus on the key concepts for the students who may be struggling or disengaged with the subject matter. By simplying the goals to a couple of concepts and contextualizing the information as what is needed to pass the class work in building personal relationships and is less intimidating for the student. </li>
                        <li>When preparing for each unit, I take a look at the New York State standards for the unit and make sure the lessons are addressing each standard. By accounting for the standards, I am able to ensure a full picture of the unit is presented to the students. I also make efforts to prepare for common mistakes that students may make by preparing questions and understanding the mistakes so that I can quickly address it to the entire class as a warning or quickly identify an individual's mistake. I personally found that addressing a mistake in a manner where I understand where it came from allows for a more open conversation. It makes the mistake seem common and reasonable, and they do not feel as bad making a mistake since it is so common. I also make efforts in using warm-ups and examples to contextualize the theories and concepts in the real world. This provides easier access to the material as well as provide examples that the students can more deeply engage with as high school math transistions to becoming more and more theoretical. </li>
                        <li>Student Notes and Homework
                            <iframe src="geosequencework.pdf" width="100%" height="800px"></iframe>

                        <li>This collection of student notes and homework is on a lesson about geometric sequences. This topic goes on about patterns and the more obscure patterns shown by geometric sequences. In this lesson, I went over a multitude of examples and explanations, but consistently emphasized the use of the formulas. Utilizing formulas and understanding sequences are what is required as a standard for the course. Specifically looking at formulas, students should be able to understand a mathematical formula, find the key values, and solve for the desired value. Although each of the notes differed when it came to the classwork and solving problems, they all make sure to write down the key formulas and add additional notes if needed explaining these formulas. The success of this approach was expressed through their answers on the homeworks which were a mass improvement over previous units and the prior lesson. This lesson did not have as many ways to apply the content as the prior lesson with word problems, but the homework and notes showcase numerous ways to present the same concept. The different ways force the students to have a deeper understanding of what each variable in the formula represents and identify its value in each scenario. Some scenarios have them labeled, some are patterns, and some are in summation notation (which was intimidating for the students at first). </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Carrying out a lesson is a time full of exchanges between the educator and the learners. The educator communicates through the lessons by planning lectures, activities, and assignments. The learner responds with questions and completing assessments. Focusing first on the teacher's side of communication, I center my planning around being accessible to all. As mentioned previously, this includes a lot of variety in instruction with collaboration, activities, lectures, and practice. These different practices are drawn from outside resources such as NCTM, texts, or talking to other teachers. I am still exploring different instructional strategies and writing lesson plans to ensure that these lessons are meeting the needs of every student. These plans have sections that focus on how each lesson addresses a special student or student group. It also includes procedures that highlight new strategies. By properly planning communication on my end, it makes the message come across more smoothly and effectively for each learner. I have personally grown in experimenting a lot more with different strategies, especially after building up a classroom environment that is engaged and willing to try out different practices.</li>
                        <li>On the other side of communication, students respond with their understanding of the content. This can come informally by looking over at their work and answering their questions. Some questions are planned beforehand to assess their understanding, but it is informal and provides small pieces of data to check the temperature of the class. A more formal form of assessment is the use of assignments and exams. Homeworks provide a consistent check-in on student ability as well as practice. Exams provide a more long-term insight on retained knowledge. It can also serve to test more complex questions that require application of multiple topics and earlier lessons. All these forms of assessment are necessary as it provides an understanding of the audience. The pace of the classroom can be altered to best fit the current needs of the learners. This insight is one of the main goals of assessment, so they should be treated with this in mind. I have grown to adjust the importance of these assessments through my personal emphasis during class or the weight it has on their grades to impact how much I want students to focus on them. This balance is something I have continued to work on and adjust for different classes.</li>

                        <li>Focusing more on the homeworks in these artifacts, it showcases the communication between both parties. Communication during classtime is made easier by being able to address any miscommunication immediately. Homework has its additional challenge of the educator not being nearby to answer questions or provide any other assistance. The main resource they have are the notes taken during classtime. In these homeworks, the questions range from the difficulty in the questions and build up to combine problem solving skills to solve multi-step problems. Scaffolding within the homeworks allows students to first gain comfort with the new topic before tackling more challenging problems. It can have some mishaps, as displayed with the 2nd artifact. This was an earlier homework assignment given after a quick lesson. There was a lot of information provided and although this student had all the formulas in their notes to solve the problems, they were unable to. Having this communication through assessments allowed me to see a need in going over this lesson again and allowed me to personally address this student's concerns by writing a partial answer for one of the questions they were unable to answer. </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I have learned so much through all the courses taken exploring different philosophies of education. These readings were fascinating to me as I sought out a wide range of beliefs to gain an open perspective of education. These findings of research and theoretical insights based off of human behavior guide my practice to be more explorative. It leads into the practical application of observing my practice and the practice of others to see the theory put into reality. This practice is complemented with personal field notes taken during or immediately after the lesson to keep track of the effectiveness and my personal reflections on the lesson. I also seek out collaboration with others by observing different classes and having others observe my lessons and provide feedback. When I did have the chance to work with a co-teacher specializing in special education, I was able to bounce off a lot of ideas and check in on my assessments to see if they were appropriate for the students. It was a very insightful experience that helped me grow in planning for differentation. </li>
                        <li>The school environments I have worked at and interviewed at have helped me grow in seeing the importance of a supportive educational faculty. With meeting between teams of educators, collaboration is encouraged and teachers are able to share ideas and bounce of questions to better their lessons for the next day. Communicating with parents and other faculty serve as a different lens in how we should approach students. Professional development seminars and activities build unity and collective growth in the entire faculty and even school direction. There is so much to be done in a healthy school environment that all serve to better the education for the students.</li>

                        <li>This artifact showcases a homework assignment and its modified versions that were provided for students who received accomodations. I collaborated with the co-teacher mentioned previously through conversations and questions asking about which key concepts must be kept and what skills should be practiced. This particular homework has modifications that removed the use of fraction values, shorted and made the answers for one question more uniform, and removed the word problem. What remains on the homework are one step expressions, substituting values, and tape diagrams which are all key 7th grade standards.  </li>
